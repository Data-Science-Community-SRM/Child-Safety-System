      <body>He was pretty good in that treasure hunting movie with Jessica Alba...      Don't all actors work for the green?  Make that paper while you can...</body>

      <body> Yes, actors work for the green, but usually the are somewhat good...This guy is justs horrible...Even his good looks can't compensate for his lack of talent...I want to know who he knows... I can't even believe you tried to defend him with a Walker/Alba collaboration...she is the famale equivalent of Paul Walker...</body>

      <body>   There is a fine line between actors and models.  For some the line is finer than for others.  I for one, watched the movie SIMPLY to see attractive actors on a beautiful beach location.  In the DVD featurettes, the actors stated as a simple fact that they were selected for their looks.  It was completely an unapologetic eye-candy fest.  And it delievered.  Every movie doesn't have to be Saving Private Ryan.  Some movies just need actors that are good-looking and charismatic...</body>
