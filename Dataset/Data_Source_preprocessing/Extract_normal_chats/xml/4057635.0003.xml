      <body>Let's briefly recap waterboarding in the US for some of the more senile, shellshocked, and/or generally stupid Americans who support this torture:  -As far back as the Spanish-American War, American servicemen were court-martialed for waterboarding suspected insurgents in the Philippines.  -Japanese troops and the Nazi Gestapo used this torture. Japanese were later convicted of war crimes due to their use of the practice on American POWs.  -During the Vietnam war, US Generals declared the practice illegal and several court martials occurred due to the revelation that the practice was being carried out by US and South Vietnamese troops.   The Imperial Japanese, the Fascist Nazis, the Pinochet regime, the Khmer Rouge, etc have all used waterboarding. And now the US does. Nice company we keep, don't you think?</body>

      <body> Another reason they go through it is to weed out weaklings. Steal-your assertion that "anyone who swims or surfs alot can easily beat this" is completely ridiculous. Do you really think this is where the interrogation stops if no information is obtained? They go straight from waterboarding to beatings and electric shocks. The difference with this video, and the training of our military personnel, is that the training eventually stops. The torture to extract information does not.  I'd really like to see any of the dumbasses in here who support this go through it just once. They'd admit to having sex with their own mother or father to make it stop. ESPECIALLY if they didn't know what was coming next. Could be freedom, could be jumper cables attached to their testicles. They'd say anything to get the first, and they'd say anything to prevent the second. That's why torture has been proven time and time again to not get the real information you need. Gaining a prisoner's trust and extracting information through more subversive measures is far more likely to get the desired results.</body>
